            The only way to find out if you'll be accepted for a loan is to apply. Yet that leaves a mark on your credit file that other
            lenders can see, potentially affecting your ability to get future credit. This tool finds out your chances of getting loans
            before you apply, helping you apply for the right loan first time.
